# Agentic Implementation Plan

Before any code execution for complex tasks, generate a plan artifact using this structure:

## 1. 🎯 Summary
- High-level architectural goal.
- List of specialized sub-agents required for parallel execution.

## 2. 🗺️ Strategy
- **File Diff Preview:** List every file to be created or modified.
- **Breaking Changes:** Explicitly flag if this change breaks existing APIs or DB schemas.

## 3. 🚨 Risk Assessment
- **Risk Level:** [LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH]
- **Rollback Plan:** Specific steps to undo the changes if the build fails.
- **Human Gate:** If Risk is HIGH, stop and wait for a "PROCEED" command.

## 4. 🧪 Verification Plan
- Specific commands to run (e.g., `go test ./internal/auth/...`, or whatever the test command is for the project).
- Expected visual/log output for success.
- Write new temporary tests to verify your changes (if possible).
